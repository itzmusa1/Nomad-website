            <p>
                The Lalibela Church refers to a group of 11 rock-hewn
                churches located in the town of Lalibela in northern Ethiopia. 
                These churches were carved out of solid rock in the 12th century 
                under the direction of King Lalibela, who wanted to create a "New 
                Jerusalem" in Ethiopia. The churches are considered remarkable 
                architectural and engineering achievements, with intricate carvings, 
                underground passageways, and unique features such as windows, doors, 
                and columns all chiseled out of the rock. The Lalibela Church complex 
                is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and an important pilgrimage site for 
                Ethiopian Orthodox Christians. It is one of the most iconic and significant 
                religious sites in Ethiopia and attracts visitors from around the world.<br>
