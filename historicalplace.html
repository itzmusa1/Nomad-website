                The Axum obelisks are a group of tall, carved stone 
                pillars located in the ancient city of Axum in northern 
                Ethiopia. These obelisks date back to the ancient Kingdom 
                of Axum and are believed to have been erected as early as 
                the 4th century AD. They served as markers of graves or important 
                locations and were symbols of the power and wealth of the Axumite rulers. 
                The largest obelisk, known as the Great Stele, is over 24 meters tall and 
                weighs around 160 tons. The Axum obelisks are UNESCO World Heritage Sites 
                and are significant cultural and historical landmarks in Ethiopia.<br>
